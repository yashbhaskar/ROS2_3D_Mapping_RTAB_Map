# ROS2_3D_Mapping_RTAB_Map
The repository provides a complete simulation and mapping for performing 3D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using RTAB-Map within the ROS 2 ecosystem. This is designed for researchers, developers, and students who aim to explore autonomous 3D environment perception, mapping, and navigation in both simulated and real-world scenarios.
